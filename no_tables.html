    This is a basic two-column web page layout. The left column or the <em>menu column</em>
    is a narrow band of space (usually between 15-25% of the page width) and
    is reserved for a menu of hyperlinks leading to other pages on your website.
    The table used to create this layout employs a single table row containing two table cells.

<p>
    The right column or the <em>content column</em>takes up the lion's share of the
    web page width and contains the catual content of each particular page. In a basic
    two column layout like this, it is common to place the website logo at the top of
    the content column on each page.
